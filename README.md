## Project Overview
Exit signs cost anywhere from $30-250 to replace depending on location and quality.  Over recent years, universities have had to deal with an endemic of students damaging exit signs, which leads to very costly repairs.
According to VT Housing, Virginia Tech spent over $20000 replacing exit signs just last year. To help universities save money by developing a durable-tamper-resistant exit sign. Our exit signs use strong but flexible polymers and spring-loaded mounts in order to be nearly indestructible by usual vandalism. We have also designed a PCB for the sign and plan to implement a PWM signal for LEDs into the design. We plan to use the AMP lab for soldering components on PCBs and testing the PCBs.

## Educational Value Added
The project will help with PCB design, soldering components onto PCBs, testing PCBs with time-varying signals, and reading and understanding specification sheets for components.


## Tasks

PCB has been designed and finalized.
