IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview
To help universities save money by developing a durable-tamper-resistant exit sign. Our exit signs use strong but flexible polymers and spring-loaded mounts in order to be nearly indestructible by usual vandalism. We have also designed a PCB for the sign and plan to implement a PWM signal for LEDs into the design.


## Educational Value Added

Exit signs cost anywhere from $30-250 to replace depending on location and quality.  Over recent years, universities have had to deal with an endemic of students damaging exit signs, which leads to very costly repairs.
According to VT Housing, Virginia Tech spent over $20000 replacing exit signs just last year.
